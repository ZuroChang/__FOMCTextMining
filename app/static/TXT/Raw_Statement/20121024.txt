['\n\n       Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September suggests that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months.\xa0 Growth in employment has been slow, and the unemployment rate remains elevated.\xa0 Household spending has advanced a bit more quickly, but growth in business fixed investment has slowed.\xa0 The housing sector has shown some further signs of improvement, albeit from a depressed level.\xa0 Inflation recently picked up somewhat, reflecting higher energy prices.\xa0 Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.\n    \n\n       Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.\xa0 The Committee remains concerned that, without sufficient policy accommodation, economic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions.\xa0 Furthermore, strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook.\xa0 The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely would run at or below its 2 percent objective.\n    \n\n       To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee will continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month.\xa0 The Committee also will continue through the end of the year its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of Treasury securities, and it is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed \xa0securities in agency mortgage-backed securities.\xa0 These actions, which together will increase the Committeeâ€™s holdings of longer-term securities by about $85 billion each month through the end of the year, should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative.\n    \n\n       The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months.\xa0 If the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities, undertake additional asset purchases, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until such improvement is achieved in a context of price stability.\xa0 In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will, as always, take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.\n    \n\n       To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens.\xa0 In particular, the Committee also decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted at least through mid-2015.\n    \n\n       Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; William C. Dudley, Vice Chairman; Elizabeth A. Duke; Dennis P. Lockhart; Sandra Pianalto; Jerome H. Powell; Sarah Bloom Raskin; Jeremy C. Stein; Daniel K. Tarullo; John C. Williams; and Janet L. Yellen. \xa0Voting against the action was Jeffrey M. Lacker, who opposed additional asset purchases and disagreed with the description of the time period over which a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate and exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted.\n    \n']
