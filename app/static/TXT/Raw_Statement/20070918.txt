['\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 50 basis points to 4-3/4 percent.\nEconomic growth was moderate during the first half of the year, but the tightening of credit conditions has the potential to intensify the housing correction and to restrain economic growth more generally.\xa0 Today’s action is intended to help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and to promote moderate growth over time.\xa0 \nReadings on core inflation have improved modestly this year.\xa0 However, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain, and it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.\xa0 \nDevelopments in financial markets since the Committee’s last regular meeting have increased the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook.\xa0 The Committee will continue to assess the effects of these and other developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth.\nVoting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, Vice Chairman; Charles L. Evans; Thomas M. Hoenig; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Frederic S. Mishkin; William Poole; Eric Rosengren; and Kevin M. Warsh. \xa0 \nIn a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 50-basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 5-1/4 percent.\xa0 In taking this action, the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Cleveland, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco.\n']
