['\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 75 basis points to 2-1/4 percent.\nRecent information indicates that the outlook for economic activity has weakened further. Growth in consumer spending has slowed and labor markets have softened.\xa0 Financial markets remain under considerable stress, and the tightening of credit conditions and the deepening of the housing contraction are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters.\nInflation has been elevated, and some indicators of inflation expectations have risen.\xa0 The Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters, reflecting a projected leveling-out of energy and other commodity prices and an easing of pressures on resource utilization.\xa0 Still, uncertainty about the inflation outlook has increased.\xa0 It will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.\nTodayâ€™s policy action, combined with those taken earlier, including measures to foster market liquidity, should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate the risks to economic activity.\xa0 However, downside risks to growth remain.\xa0 The Committee will act in a timely manner as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.\nVoting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, Vice Chairman; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Frederic S. Mishkin; Sandra Pianalto; Gary H. Stern; and Kevin M. Warsh.\xa0 Voting against were Richard W. Fisher and Charles I. Plosser, who preferred less aggressive action at this meeting. \nIn a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 75-basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 2-1/2 percent.\xa0 In taking this action, the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, and San Francisco.\n']
