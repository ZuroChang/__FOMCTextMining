['\n\n\r\nThe Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at 1-1/4 percent.\r\nThe Committee continues to believe that this accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with still robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing support to economic activity.  The limited number of incoming economic indicators since the November meeting, taken together, are not inconsistent with the economy working its way through its current soft spot.\r\nIn these circumstances, the Committee believes that, against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are balanced with respect to the prospects for both goals for the foreseeable future.\r\nVoting for the FOMC monetary policy action were Alan Greenspan, Chairman; William J. McDonough, Vice Chairman; Ben S. Bernanke, Susan S. Bies; Roger W. Ferguson, Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Jerry L. Jordan; Donald L. Kohn, Robert D. McTeer, Jr.; Mark W. Olson; Anthony M. Santomero, and Gary H. Stern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n2002 Monetary policy\n\n Home | News and \r\nevents \nAccessibility\n\n\nLast update: December 10, 2002\n\n']
