['\nThe Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points to 4-1/2 percent.\nEconomic growth was solid in the third quarter, and strains in financial markets have eased somewhat on balance.\xa0 However, the pace of economic expansion will likely slow in the near term, partly reflecting the intensification of the housing correction.\xa0 Todayâ€™s action, combined with the policy action taken in September, should help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and promote moderate growth over time.\nReadings on core inflation have improved modestly this year, but recent increases in energy and commodity prices, among other factors, may put renewed upward pressure on inflation.\xa0 In this context, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain, and it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.\xa0\nThe Committee judges that, after this action, the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the downside risks to growth.\xa0 The Committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth. \nVoting for the FOMC monetary policy action were:\xa0 Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, Vice Chairman; Charles L. Evans; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Frederic S. Mishkin; William Poole; Eric S. Rosengren; and Kevin M. Warsh.\xa0 Voting against was Thomas M. Hoenig, who preferred no change in the federal funds rate at this meeting.\nIn a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 5 percent.\xa0 In taking this action, the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco.\n']
