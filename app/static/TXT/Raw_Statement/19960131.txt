['\nFor immediate release\n', '\r\n\r\nThe Federal Reserve today announced the following policy \r\nactions:\r\n\r\n\nThe Board of Governors approved a reduction in the discount rate from \r\n5-1/4 percent to 5 percent, effective immediately.\r\n\r\nIn a related move, the Federal Open Market Committee agreed that the \r\nreduction would be reflected fully in interest rates in\r\nthe reserve markets. This is expected to result in a reduction in the \r\nfederal funds rate of 25 basis points, from about 5-1/2\r\npercent to about 5-1/4 percent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nModerating economic expansion in recent months has reduced potential\r\ninflationary pressures going forward. With price and cost trends\r\nalready subdued, a slight easing of monetary policy is consistent with\r\ncontained inflation and sustainable growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn taking the discount action, the Board approved requests submitted\r\nby the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York,\r\nPhiladelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas.\r\n\r\n\r\n']
